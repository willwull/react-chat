# react-chat
A responsive chat/messenger component made with React.

This is just a simple front end for a chat, whose appearance is based on Facebook Messenger and iMessage.

The chat component (`ChatPanel.js`) will adapt its size to its container component/div/whatever by filling it out completely.

## How to try out locally
You can try it out at the link above, but if you want to try it out locally, just follow these steps:

1. Install NodeJS.
2. Clone this repo and type `npm install` in your terminal, inside the repo directory.
3. `npm start`.

## Dependencies
* Bootstrap
    * I originally made this chat component to be used in something else, which has Bootstrap (v4). I could probably rewrite it to not be dependent on Bootstrap, but I don't see any need as of now.
    * Please note that I used regular Bootstrap and not react-bootstrap for this project.
* Font Awesome
    * This project needs Font Awesome for the send icon.
